Deeper still within the data center's framework, you confront a
critical malfunction in the system's core process. The system is 
in a cycle of disruption and restoration. You realize the need 
for a more robust approach, a while loop is the only method 
capable of maintaining stability through this section of the 
system.

You can no longer issue direct commands without a pre-condition.

Write a script with a while loop by checking the t/f condition 
"blockInfront isPassable," use it to iterate until your character 
reaches the reboot point. Use directional commands ("Up", "Down",
"Left", "Right") nested under a while loop to iterate through the 
system.
