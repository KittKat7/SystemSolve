		<h3>Conditions</h3>
		A condition is a true or false value depending one some condition. These conditions are used in if statements
		and while loops to determine its behavior. If the condition for the if statement is true, then the if statement
		will run, otherwise the if's code will be skipped. If statements can also be negated by using <code>!</code> in
		front of the condition. For example <code>isOnGoal</code> is true if the player is on the goal, however
		<code>!isOnGoal</code> is true if the player is NOT on the goal.
